                <p class="hero">For the past couple of years, Zappos has been in transition: moving from a traditional bureaucratic management system to a revolutionary new setup: a Holacracy. The radical transition, while bumpy for the company, has caught the attention of the media and the public at large; everyone is interested to see how Zappos will implement a Holacracy and whether it will be successful. We took a deep look at this bold move through the lenses of <strong>rituals, charismatic authority, reinforcement politics,</strong> and <strong>isomorphism.</strong></p>

                        <p>From the start, Zappos was proudly run to be a different sort of company. Stories published regarding their corporate culture paint the company as a veritable zoo, with odd traditions, brightly colored decorations and factions, and an apparent disrespect for traditional concepts of respect for hierarchy. It’s quite possible, in our assessment, that the company’s obsession with differentiation and odd, yet powerfully solidarity-reinforcing, rituals not only served as a model for businesses looking to break the mold and adopt modern corporate cultures, but also was intended from the start to serve as such a model.</p>

                        <h2>Customer Service</h2>
                        <p>Zappos' call centers (and the employees who work there) are first-class citizens in the company. Customer service in general is a huge priority in the eyes of CEO Tony Hsieh. In fact, every new employee is trained for call center work for a short period before entering the position they were hired for (Nightline, 2008). Listening to the Zappos employees featured in their 2008 Nightline segment speak of this aspect of their culture, it becomes clear that this Kunda-esque ritual is used to create a mentality in new employees that customer service is directly related to every aspect of the company (Kunda, 2006).</p>

                        <h2>Meet the Zoo</h2>
                        <p>Even before Holacracy, Zappos' corporate culture has always been a little bit ... weird. During the onboarding process, new employees are offered a cash bonus to quit on the spot after a very brief time on the job (Taylor, 2008). Zappos stresses that if you are the type of person who would take this offer, you are not the type of employee the company would like to keep. There is a clear “us vs. them” mentality in this speech. One can imagine that for the employees that do not take the offer, this ritual serves to convince them that they really belong as a member of Zappos, and thus they might buy in more to the culture narrative that the company offers. For someone who accepts the Zappos way of doing things and decides to stay after “The Offer,” the act of actively confirming that you agree to do things according to the Zappos way likely has the psychological effect of committing the employee to that culture and its goals.</p>

                        </div>

                        <p>Zappos has a myriad of other widely publicized oddities throughout its culture. In what could be seen as an attempt to minimize the visible aspects of hierarchy, the company’s executives are called “monkeys,” and their executive offices termed “Monkey Row” (Lewine, 2013). The monkeys’ executive assistants are similarly nicknamed, instead referred to as “Time Ninjas” (ibid). On frequent tours offered through its offices, the company’s employees greet guests with cowbells and blown horns (Palmeri 2009), letting everyone who comes to see the company — many of whom do so to witness its abnormal culture — that this is not a normal company.</p>

                        <h2>Culture as Product</h2>
                        <p>Zappos’ culture is so proudly and publicly different that it can feel produced. In fact, the company markets its culture as if it were a product. In 2008, Zappos started selling management seminars explaining how to recreate its famous culture in any company and it manages Zappos Insights, an online training program aimed at the same goal: “Sharing the Zappos Culture with the World.” In this way Zappos can take advantage of mimetic isomorphism, wherein any company willing to change its culture can look at Zappos as a model, and pay them to learn the secrets that should bring them success and legitimacy as well (DiMaggio, 1991).</p>

                        <p>The most amazing part of the Zappos story, however, is that the management practices they sell so enthusiastically actually seem to work — at least, the earlier, more business-relevant ones, like the firm’s focus on customer service. They stumbled upon a strategy that works exceptionally well in an era where Internet-based retailers suffer greatly from lackluster customer service, and the markets respond well to exceptions to that rule. So, with that success in hand, the company can move forward and develop additional aspects of its culture, whether or not they actually produce measurable results, and rely on their success to legitimize their approach, wherever it differs from the more customary corporate cultures.</p>

                        <h2>Hsieh as Charismatic CEO</h2>

                        <div class="thumbnail" style="max-width: 400px">
                            <img alt="" src="img/hsieh-portrait.jpg">
                            <div class="caption center">
                                <p>CEO Tony Hsieh</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <p>We can also see Tony Hsieh, with his millions of followers on Twitter and management-guru status, as a charismatic CEO along the lines of Weber’s theory of charismatic authority (Weber, 1968). As many people and businesses look to him for advice on how to run the perfect corporate culture, he can bring in profits for Zappos through that wing of their business with relatively little overhead.</p>

                        <h2>Moving to something new</h2>

                        <p>With all of this in mind, the next step for Zappos seems relatively logical. An extreme emphasis on customer service, cute names for executives, and cash rewards for quitting are new and exciting only for a certain amount of time. As other companies adopt the quirky practices, perhaps even through Zappos’ own seminars, Zappos’ approach would necessarily start to seem stale. The company obviously needed something new to offer if their management product were to continue to sell.</p>

                        <p>Thus enters Holacracy. With Holacracy, Zappos could remove all doubt that their management practices were legitimate — Holacracy, after all, was invented by someone else, not by Zappos. Now, they could sell seminars about how to use Holacracy, and the legitimacy could come from two sources instead of one: from their lasting legacy as a culture innovator as well as from the inherent legitimacy that Holacracy possessed as a consequence of its design. Zappos could legitimize Holacracy while at the same time using it to continue selling a new generation of organizational training.</p>

                    <h1>After the Switch</h1>
                </div>

                <div class="row">

                        	Zappos first introduced “Holacracy” as a concept to their employees in their fourth quarter meeting of 2013 (Groth, 2013). Bookended with “zany” events that are central to an employee’s experience at Zappos, the announcement signaled a very serious change in the Zappos corporate climate; one that would indicate Tony Hsieh’s commitment to an employee-focused company in not only informal settings, but formal as well. Zappos’ structure would mimic its culture, a move that would upend the tradition of a loosely-coupled corporate setting as described by Meyer and Rowan (Meyer, 1977). where participants have specific, different roles that they play in formal meetings and in more casual gatherings,These roles are now merged, as employees work on more equal footing with one another. While the switch to Holacracy was scheduled to complete one year after introduction, by March 2015, only 85% of employees had begun the transition process (Feloni, 2015).

                        <h2>The Email that Rocked the Zappos World</h2>

                        <p>
                        	On March 24, 2015, Hsieh sent an email to all 1,500 employees at Zappos, giving them an ultimatum. Everyone at the company had until April 30 (roughly one month) to accept Holacracy or they would be forced to leave the company with a three-month severance package. This all-in approach divided the company, but Hsieh was adamant about adopting Holacracy (Feloni, 2015). Once again, Hsieh asserts his authority as the CEO and continues the rituals typically associated with being CEO. His decision is still final. He also continues his role as the charismatic leader, leading his company into the unknown with promises of a better, more productive company.

                        <h2> Employee Response </h2>
                        <p>
                        	By May 2015, 210 of Zappos employees (14%) left the company, accepting the severance packages. Holacracy critics used this statistic as proof that Hsieh’s plan was insane, with them saying, “Hsieh is conducting one of the biggest experiments in management history, but one in seven employees didn’t want to take part” (Feloni, 2015). However, Hsieh was optimistic because he felt that those who stayed are the ones passionate about Holacracy and making it work at Zappos; this viewpoint is very reminiscent of his cash offer for new employees to leave. While it is still too soon to say whether Holacracy is a success or not, the immediate effects and responses have been mixed. 

                        	In a personal video made by an employee at Zappos, Kristy Meade gives her very positive experience with Holacracy. She details how Holacracy was the difference between just knowing what your project is about and really internalizing the entire project and how it will affect everyone. Meade says she was on board from the beginning, but now really believes in it, as though it is almost a religious movement. However, she does caution that the transition is not easy and that you’re going to mess up in the beginning and it is, at times, hard to understand, but that is what is supposed to happen. “If you’re breaking it, you’re doing it right,” Meade warns.

                        <p> 
                        	Other employees and analysts tell a slightly grimmer story, however. They point out that there seems to be a steep learning curve to Holacracy, claiming that “the procedural formality of Holacracy, the ever-expanding number of circles and the endless meetings [are] a drain on productivity. ‘It’s taking time away from getting the actual work done,’” (Gelles, 2015). There are still definite adjustments that need to be made, such as determining how salaries will be allocated and how to assign and approve projects. 

                        	Regardless Hsieh is optimistic, but still acknowledges the growing pains of Holacracy. “In late May, … at a Zappos all-hands meeting, [the usual] jovial affairs featuring circus performers and the like… was more reflective. By some measure, Zappos was thriving, Mr. Hsieh said, sharing business updates from the quarter. But he also acknowledged that the transition to Holacracy had not been going smoothly” (Gelles, 2015). From the beginning though, Hsieh has known this transition would not be an easy one. “In his memo, Hsieh wrote that after April 30, transforming Zappos would feel like upgrading an airplane as it flies through the air. ‘Like all the bold steps we’ve done in the past, it feels a little scary, but it also feels like exactly the type of thing that only a company such as Zappos would dare to attempt at this scale” (Feloni, 2015).
